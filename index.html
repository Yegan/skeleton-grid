            Paris also commonly known as the city of lights or love.
              Paris is ranked amongst one of the top tourist destinations to visit.
              The Eiffel Tower being one of the most iconic man made structures in the world.
              I would really love to get to know the city as well as discover the French culutre and cuisine.
